## Overview of Subfolders

**[GTF_GFF_files]():** Provides GFF or GTF annotations.  This may be helpful for quantifying expression, visualizing annotations in [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/), etc.

**[Alignment_and_Quantification_for_Expression]():** Provides details for gene expression alignment, as well as some details related to quantification.

***An additional section will be added to help explain the iterations of analysis, including scripts to create figures and tables for the paper.***

**[STAR_Splice_Junction_Evidence]():** Code used to define evdience categories (A, B, C, or D) for gene candidate annotations, using the splice junction counts from the [STAR aligner](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR).

**[Repeat_Annotations]():** scripts to run [RepeatMaster](https://www.repeatmasker.org/) and [Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF)](https://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html), along reformatting for annotations.  *Some code may be revised in a future update*
