## Overview of Subfolders

**[GTF_GFF_files](https://github.com/cwarden45/Miller_Red_Jungle_Fowl_MHCY/tree/main/Part2_Annotation/GTF_GFF_files):** Provides GFF or GTF annotations.  This may be helpful for quantifying expression, visualizing annotations in [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/), etc.

**[Alignment_and_Quantification_for_Expression](https://github.com/cwarden45/Miller_Red_Jungle_Fowl_MHCY/tree/main/Part2_Annotation/Alignment_and_Quantification_for_Expression):** Provides details for gene expression alignment, as well as some details related to quantification.

**[Gene_Annotation_Iterations](https://github.com/cwarden45/Miller_Red_Jungle_Fowl_MHCY/tree/main/Part2_Annotation/Gene_Annotation_Iterations)**: Provides selected code to help explainthe iterations of analysis, including some scripts to reproduce content for the publication.

**[STAR_Splice_Junction_Evidence](https://github.com/cwarden45/Miller_Red_Jungle_Fowl_MHCY/tree/main/Part2_Annotation/STAR_Splice_Junction_Evidence):** Code used to define evdience categories (A, B, C, or D) for gene candidate annotations, using the splice junction counts from the [STAR aligner](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR).

**[Repeat_Annotations](https://github.com/cwarden45/Miller_Red_Jungle_Fowl_MHCY/tree/main/Part2_Annotation/STAR_Splice_Junction_Evidence):** scripts to run [RepeatMaster](https://www.repeatmasker.org/) and [Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF)](https://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html), along reformatting for annotations.  *Some code may be revised in a future update*
