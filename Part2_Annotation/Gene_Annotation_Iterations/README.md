## Overview of Subfolders

[Annotation_Update_Example](https://github.com/cwarden45/Miller_Red_Jungle_Fowl_MHCY/tree/main/Part2_Annotation/Gene_Annotation_Iterations/Annotation_Update_Example) - example code to reproduce a main figure and some details related to gene candidate assessment.

[Additional_Revision_Details](https://github.com/cwarden45/Miller_Red_Jungle_Fowl_MHCY/tree/main/Part2_Annotation/Gene_Annotation_Iterations/Additional_Revision_Details) - additional selected details intended to help provide more of an overall sense of the iterations of analysis that occurred to produce the current set of annotations.

[gtf-pileup_liftOver](https://github.com/cwarden45/Miller_Red_Jungle_Fowl_MHCY/tree/main/Part2_Annotation/Gene_Annotation_Iterations/gtf-pileup_liftOver) - revisions had to be transfered between annotation assemblies, and that requried some methods testing and a custom strategy to transfer annotations between assemblies.  Some extra work was needed, but this appeared to minimize the amount of manual work needed to transfer our gene candidate annotations when changes were made to the underlying assembly.
